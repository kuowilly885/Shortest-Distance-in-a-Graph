# Shortest-Distance-in-a-Graph
Using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path in the weighted graph.
The following are the example of the weighted graph.

A B 4
A C 2
A D 10
C B 3
C D 7
B E 1
C E 8
C F 10
C G 7
D G 12
F G 1
F E 5
E H 2
F H 3
G H 1

src/file.txt is the input file for this program.
You can customize your weighted graph in src/file.txt.
